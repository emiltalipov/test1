 <h3>ACT 1</h3>
 <h3>PROLOGUE</h3>>

<pre>
Two households, both alike in dignity,In fair Verona, where we lay our scene, 
From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean. 
From forth the fatal loins of these two foesA pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life 
Whose misadventured piteous overthrowsDo with their death bury their parent's rage, 
Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,Is now the two hour's traffic of our stage; 
The which if you with patient ears attend,What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend. 



GREGORY 
No, for then we should be colliers.
<span><b> SCENE I. Verona. A public place. </b></span>>
<i> Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet, armed with swords and bucklers</i>
<span><b>SAMPSON </b></span>
Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
