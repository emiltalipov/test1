       <h3><b>linear Equation</b></h3>
        A linear equation is any equation that can be written in the form

         <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet">ax + b = 0</span></h2>
          
        where a and b are real numbers and x is a variable. This form is sometimes called the standard form of a linear
        equation. Note that most linear equations will not start off in this form. Also, the variable may or may not be an <b>x</b> 
        so don’t get too locked into always seeing an <b>x</b> there.
          
          <h3><b>Quadratic Equation</b></h3>
          
          The standard form of a quadratic equation looks like this:
          
          <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet"> ax<sup>2</sup> + bx + c = 0  </span></h2>
          
          where a, b, c are known values and x is the variable or unknown (we don't know it yet). Also, a can't be 0.
          
         <h3><b> The area of a circle (A)</b></h3>
          
          [sign] (Pi) times the radius (r) squared:
          
          <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet"> A = [sign] [sign] r<sup>2</sup>  </span></h2>
          
          or, when you know the diameter (D):
          <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet"> A = [sign] / 4) [sign] D<sup>2</sup>>  </span></h2>
          
          or, when you know the circumference (C):
          <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet">  A = C<sup>2</sup>> / 4 [sign] [sign] </span></h2>
          
          <h3><b>Intersection</b></h3>
          
          The intersection of two sets A and B, denoted by A [sign] B, is the set of all objects that are members of both the sets A and B. In symbols,
          
          <h2 id="formula"><span id="cwet"> A [sign] B = { x : x [sign] A and x [sign] B }  </span></h2>
          
          That is, x is an element of the intersection A [sign] B if and only if x is both an element of A and an element of B.
